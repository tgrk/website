### Disclaimer

#### Liability for Content

The contents of our pages have been created with the utmost care. However, we cannot guarantee the contents' accuracy, completeness, or topicality. According to statutory provisions, we are furthermore responsible for our own content on these web pages. In this matter, please note that we are not obliged to monitor the transmitted or saved information of third parties, or investigate circumstances pointing to illegal activity.

Our obligations to remove or block the use of information under generally applicable laws remain unaffected by this as per §§ 8 to 10 of the Telemedia Act (TMG).

#### Liability for Links

Our offer contains links to external third-party websites. We have no influence on the contents of those websites; therefore, we cannot guarantee the external content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the contents of those pages.

The linked pages were checked for possible legal violations when linked. Illegal contents were not recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent content control of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. If we become aware of legal violations, we will remove such links immediately.

The duplication, processing, distribution, or any form of utilization beyond the scope of copyright law shall require the prior written consent of the author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private, non-commercial use.

As far as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is identified as such. Should you become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such content immediately.
