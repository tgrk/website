### Overview

Development teams continually look (or at least should) for ways to improve their workflows and increase productivity. One way to achieve this is by using JIRA automation to streamline the Github pull request (PR) development cycle. JIRA automation can automate many tasks related to Github PRs, from creating JIRA issues to updating issue statuses based on PR state.
This post covers setting up JIRA automation, automating Github pull requests, and monitoring and reporting on the Github PR development cycle.

### Setting up JIRA Automation

To use JIRA automation for the GitHub PR development cycle, you must first set up JIRA automation rules. These rules will automatically create JIRA issues, update them based on the GitHub PR state, and transition them to the appropriate status based on workflow.

To set up JIRA automation, follow these steps:
1) Open JIRA and navigate to the project you want to use for the GitHub PR development cycle.
2) Click "Project settings" in the sidebar, then select "Automation."
3) Click "Create Rule" to create a new automation rule.
4) Choose a trigger for the rule, such as "Issue created" or "Issue updated."
5) Add actions to the rule, such as "Create Issue," "Update Issue," or "Transition Issue."
6) Configure the actions to update JIRA issues based on the GitHub PR state.

### Automating Github Pull Requests

Once you've set up JIRA automation, you can start automating Github pull requests. JIRA automation can automatically update JIRA issues based on the GitHub PR state, such as when a new PR is opened, a PR is merged, or a rejected PR.

To automate Github pull requests, follow these steps:
1) Open JIRA and navigate to the project you want to use for the GitHub PR development cycle.
2) Click "Project settings" in the sidebar, then select "Automation."
3) Click "Create Rule" to create a new automation rule.
4) Choose a trigger for the rule, such as "Pull request updated" or "Pull request merged."
5) Add actions to the rule, such as "Update Issue," "Transition Issue," or "Add Comment."
6) Configure the actions to update JIRA issues based on the GitHub PR state.

### Monitoring and Reporting

JIRA automation can also be used to monitor and report on the GitHub PR development cycle. JIRA dashboards can be used to track key metrics, such as issue creation, pull request status, and development cycle time.

To monitor and report on the GitHub PR development cycle, follow these steps:
1) Open JIRA and navigate to the project you want to use for the GitHub PR development cycle.
2) Click "Dashboards" in the sidebar, then select "Create Dashboard."
3) Choose a dashboard-type, such as "Project dashboard" or "System dashboard."
4) Add gadgets to the dashboard to track key metrics, such as "Issue statistics," "Pull request activity," or "Cycle time."
5) Configure the gadgets to show the relevant data for your GitHub PR development cycle.

### Conclusion

Using JIRA automation for the GitHub PR development cycle can save time and increase productivity for development teams. By automating tasks such as issue creation, PR status updates, and workflow transitions, teams can focus on building great software instead of manual work. JIRA dashboards can also monitor and report on key metrics, helping teams continuously improve their processes.
