Some time ago I was asked by my ex-colleague to give a talk about Elixir, OTP and BEAM as part of PyLadies Berlin Meetup group. The objective was to do a gentle introduction into language and functional programming from point of view of an experienced Python developer.

Unfortunately, things (as usual) took a different path and I give a talk alone (with only decent Python experience) and tried to charm a wonderful audience with Elixir mixed with a bit of Functional programming as you can see from slides [here](https://speakerdeck.com/tgrk/pyladies-2018-elixir-for-pythonistas). You can also find a simple word count (yes most of Meetup folks use Python for data science) [hands project](https://github.com/tgrk/pyladies_elixir/tree/master/word_count) as well as [demo](https://github.com/tgrk/pyladies_elixir/tree/dist/word_count_dist) that I used to illustrate strengths of BEAM (distribution, parallelisation and extensibility).
