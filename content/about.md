## Introduction

I am originally from Prague, Czech Republic, and currently based in Berlin, Germany. My journey has led me to work in both big corporations and various startups/scaleups in Berlin, aiding them in achieving their ambitious goals.

## Professional Passion

My expertise lies in building mission-critical systems, distributed systems, automation tools, and intelligent solutions that address various challenges. I am passionate about open-source software and actively contribute to projects in different areas. My experience spans diverse industries, equipping me with a broad perspective and versatile skill set.

## Personal Interests

When not immersed in technology, I enjoy hobbies like reading, traveling, exploring art, and cooking (fixing all broken things I found around :-)). To balance my computer work, I do various sports, including Martial Arts, kettlebells, and running, which keep me energized and balanced.

## Specialties

- Enhancing system scalability and fault tolerance
- Developing and managing distributed systems
- Conducting performance optimizations
- Adhering to the KISS principle for streamlined processes
- Embracing cloud-native development methodologies

## Technologies

With over 20 years of experience as a software engineer and technical lead, I've had the opportunity to work with an extensive range of technologies and programming languages. My journey began with imperative languages like Perl, PHP, VB, Java, and C#, but a pivotal moment in my career was discovering Erlang/BEAM. Building my first large-scale system in Erlang was a game-changer, and it's been my language of choice ever since.

Currently, my toolkit includes:
- Erlang/OTP
- Elixir
- Golang
