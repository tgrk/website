## Introduction

I am originally from Prague and currently based in Berlin. Over the years I have worked across startups, scaleups, and larger organizations, mostly on backend-heavy products where reliability matters.

## What I Work On

I focus on distributed systems and backend/platform architecture, mainly with Erlang/OTP and Elixir. Most of my work sits between product and infrastructure: search and data APIs, recommendation and rules systems, and high-availability services that need to stay operable at scale.

In recent years I have also been integrating LLM and agentic tooling into real backend workflows. The goal is practical: improve existing systems and developer productivity without adding unnecessary complexity.

## Domains

I have worked across finance, payments, tax, media and streaming, telco, and digital platforms.

## Technologies

- Erlang/OTP
- Elixir
- Go
- JavaScript

## Outside Work

Outside engineering, I spend time with books, art, running, and martial arts.
